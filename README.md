# Facebook Streamer Mode addon

Yeah, just for fun, I tried to blur out all of the sensitive data from the screen. After some coding, I realised, it is more complicated, so this repo is an initiative. I didn't finished it, so remember, every bug is a feature.

Feel to free to contribute, or just use the 3 line code what I wrote.
